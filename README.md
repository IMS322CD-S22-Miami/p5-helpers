# p5 Helpers

This small collection of p5 examples are intended to help with some of the questions posed by all of you in this week's Canvas discussion forum.
These exmaples include:
- Detect object collisions (and drive changes when objects collide)
- Coordinate shapes so that they always appear together (kind of like grouping in Illustrator)
- Getting user input from HTML, displaying it in the p5 canvas, and using it to look up data in an object
- Making the p5 canvas responsive and using p5 variables to adjust relative sizes and spacing
- How the translate and rotate functions work
