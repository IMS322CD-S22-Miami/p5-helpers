  <p>I generally find that there are two good ways to coordinate shapes:
    <ul>
      <li>use a for loop to draw them at the same time (as seen in the moving circles)</li>
      <li>use the same variable for the location of both (as seen in the square, which will move when clicking)</li>
    </ul>
