  <p>There are several special variables in p5. We've already looked a lot at mouseX, mouseY, width, and height, but there are many other useful ones, including:
    <ul>
      <li>pmouseX & pmouseY (mouse position in previous frame)</li>
      <li>windowWidth & windowHeight (pretty much required for making a responsive canvas)</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>This example also includes a little more info into making all elements of you canvas responsive.</p>
  <div id="p5-canvas"></div>
